# Winter Games 2029 — Guest Guide (Prototype)

Static prototype web app (HTML/CSS/JS) for a “guest/athlete guide” concept:

- Choose location: **Arosa**, **Chur**, **Lenzerheide**
- Quick overview tabs: **Overview**, **Schedule**, **Map**, **Activities**, **Emergency**

Key facts (dates + sports by location) are based on the official site: `https://switzerland2029.ch/en/`.

## Run

### Option A: Open directly

Open `index.html` in your browser.

### Option B: VS Code Live Server

Run Live Server and open `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html`.

## Notes

- This is a prototype: many lists (hotels, venues, activities) are placeholders.
- The emergency numbers are included for quick access in the demo. Replace/add event-specific contacts for production.
